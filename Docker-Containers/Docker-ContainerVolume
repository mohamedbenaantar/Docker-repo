1. Running a container from mysql Image
>docker container run -d --name mydb -e MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes mysql
2. list all volumes exist on the local
docker volume ls.   ##Copied the volume ID
3. Use the volume ID taken
>docker volume inspect <volume-ID>
## You will. see on the source Mounts block the location taken from the host to that container
4. stop and remove the container
>docker container stop mydb
>docker container rm mydb
5. NOW do again 
>docker volume ls 
“You still able to see the volume means not removing the volume while removing the container”
WHAT I want to say is that “volume mapping” is for adding a friendly name to that volume with more options to create or attach an existing volume to the container.
